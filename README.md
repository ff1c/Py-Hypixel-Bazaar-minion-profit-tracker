# Py-Hypixel-Bazaar-minion-profit-tracker
Use to track bazaar prices on Hypixel.

How to use (please ignore the bad code '_'):
In 'bazaar_tracker.py', replace 'API_KEY with your own api key
Create 2 folders named 'Bazaar Profits' & 'Bazaar Profits json' once downloaded in the same directory as the 4 .py files, run the main 'bazaar_tracker.py' file to bring up tk interface. 

Interface Buttons:
  'Click to get values' fetches prices for various bazaar items from the Hypixel API, then calculates profits based on that. Values from this are cached in the 'items_info.py' file
  'Click to recalculate values' simply recalculates values based on values cached in items_info.py' file
  'Click to get values every 10 minutes' Fetches, then calculates values from API continuously every 10 minutes
